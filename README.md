# NBAStatsOptimizer

Are you finding yourself getting lost in the nba.com boxscore page? this light extension will highlight all that matters for you as well as remove player DNP rows as they do not affect the statistics, which is the main purpose of the page.

Just click on the newly added "beautify" element in the corner of the page and watch the magic.
It works on any nba.com boxscore page and for every game.

➤This extension defaults to be used with the "Night Eye - Dark mode on any website" extension, If you're not using dark readers just click the dark mode icon at the top left corner.

➤ you don't need to worry about loading time, by using the built-in Chrome DevTools performance test at different hours and devices I the results were usually around ~2%* to page loading time but never over 5% while testing without ANY other extensions in order to minimize variables as much as possible and get a good approximation.


You're welcome to send feature requests and bug reports as I will try to keep it updated if needed.

IMPORTANT - this extension is and always will be for the affordable price of 0, and it will NEVER include ads. 

Hope you'll enjoy it!

Be kind.
