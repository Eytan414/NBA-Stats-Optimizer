# NBAStatsOptimizer

Are you finding yourself getting lost in the nba.com boxscore page? this lightweight extension will highlight for you all that matters as well as remove player DNP as they do not affect the statistics,  as that's the main purpose of the page.

Just click on the newly added "beautify" element in the corner of the page and watch the magic.
It works on any nba.com boxscore page and for every game.



➤ This extension defaults to be used with the "Night Eye - Dark mode on any website" extension, If you're not using dark readers just click the dark mode icon.

➤ The two toggles can be useful whenever you look at a "lower" row due to the table headers aren't visible in a way that the stat value loses the category context.

*since the tables aren't identical in their respective columns width I've made two different toggles for each side.

Hope you'll enjoy it!

This was made for my own personal use and thought I should share it with the world:)
