Are you finding yourself getting lost in the nba.com boxscore page? this light extension will highlight all that matters for you as well as remove player DNP rows as they do not affect the statistics, which is the main purpose of the page.

âž¤ you do not need to worry about loading time, by using the built-in Chrome DevTools performance test at different hours and devices I the results were usually around ~2%* to page loading time but never over 5% while testing without ANY other extensions in order to minimize variables as much as possible and get a good approximation.

You're welcome to send feature requests and bug reports as I will try to keep it updated if needed.

Hope you'll enjoy it!

Be kind.
