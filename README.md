You're welcome to use the "Contact the developer" link for feature requests and bug reports as I will try and keep it updated.

IMPORTANT - this extension is and always will be for free, and will NEVER include ads. It was made for my own personal use and thought I should share it with the world.

Hope you'll enjoy it!
